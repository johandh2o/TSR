# Targeted Sequential Regressions

This repository presents the results of a simulation study, including synthetic data, plots, and numerical summaries in `R`, across various settings, for the estimation procedure proposed in [Recovery and inference of causal effects with sequential adjustment for confounding and attrition](https://www.degruyterbrill.com/document/doi/10.1515/jci-2024-0009/html).

## Blog entry

The results of this simulation exercise are also featured in a personal blog post: [Simulation task: recovering causal effects from post-treatment selection induced by missing outcome data](https://johandh2o.github.io/blog/posts/2023-10-15_grapeSimulation/).
